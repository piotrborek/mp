# About

Linux Music Player is a simple audio player for console.

# How to install

First, you need to install some dependencies (or check if they
are already installed):

  * ncurses
  * gstreamer1.0
  * gstreamer1.0-plugins-base
  * gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly

Notice, that in your linux distribution, these packages can have
different names.

Download binaries and untar it somewhere. And that's all.

# Some notes

Configuration file you can find in ~/.config/mp

Program heavily uses gstreamer, so if your music doesn't
play, it means that you don't have installed some gstreamer plugin(s).
